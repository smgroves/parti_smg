%% Inputs
% 1. DataPoints, double matrix with the values of different traits 
% (the coordinates, e.g. expression level of genes). Each sample is a row, 
% each trait (e.g. each gene) is a column.
% 2. algNum is an integer that chooses the algorithm to find the simplex:
%    algNum=1 :> Sisal (default)
%    algNum=2 :> MVSA 
%    algNum=3 :> MVES
%    algNum=4 :> SDVMM 
%    algNum=5 :> PCHA 
% 3. dim, an integer representing the dimension up to which the Explained Variance (ESV) 
% should be calculated. ESV is defined as the average distance between the 
% data points and the best simplex defined by the archetypes found by
% PCHA. We recommend to start with a dimension between 5 - 10, and 
%  increase the dimension until an inflexion be spotted the ESV curve.
% 4. DiscFeatName, a cell array of strings listing the Discrete Feature labels (row)  
% 5. EnMatDis, a boolean matrix with each Discrete feature as a column, 
% and each datapoint as a row. Note that the rows of the datapoints matrix 
% should match the rows of EnMatDis. In addition, the order of the columns 
% in EnMatDis should match that of DiscFeatName. it can also accept a cell
% array of strings and transform it into a boolean matrix.   
% 6. cols, The integer index of the columns of EnMatDis to booleanize, in case
% EnMatDis is a string cell array rather than a boolean matrix. To booleanize all
% columns, set to 0.
% 7. ContFeatName, a cell array of strings listing the Continuous Feature labels.
% 8. EnMatCont, a double matrix with each Continuous feature as a column, 
% and each datapoint as a row. The rows of datapoints should match those in 
% EnMatCont.
% 9. GOcat2Genes, a boolean matrix of genes x continuous features which
% indiciates, for each continuous feature, which genes are used to compute 
% the feature. For use in the leave-one-out analysis. The MakeGOMatrix 
% function can be used to compute this matrix.
% 10. binSize, a double variable ranging between 0-1, that is the fraction of the datapoints that should be grouped in a 
% single bin when calculating feature enrichments.
% 11. OutputFileName, a string that represent the name of the comma or tab delimmited file that saves all enrichment
% data. Several files will be created with different ending to specify the continuous enrichment, the discrete enrichment 
% the significant enriched features and all the features. 
%
% Output:
% arc, a double matrix of the coordinates of the archetypes in the space spanned by the
% principle components.
% arcOrig, a double matrix of the coordinates of the archetypes in the original space, defined 
% by datapoints.
% pc is a double matrix that saves the pc of the data
% errs, the confidence intervals on the position of the archetypes
% estimated by bootstrapping
% pval, a double variable - the p-value that the dataset is described by a simplex
